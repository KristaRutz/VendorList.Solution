#### By _**Krista Rutz**_

## Description

This application, utilizing an MVC framework, lets the user, in this case a small bakery, keep track of vendors and their orders. Vendors can be added dynamically in a form, and orders for bread and pastries can be made under each vendor account. The app implements this with C# and .NET Core.

This project uses RESTful routing, the Razor View Engine, and MSTest. It was created for the Epicodus week 10 friday independent project, on week 3 of C# and .NET course: Basic Web Applications.

The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/KristaRutz/VendorList.Solution).
